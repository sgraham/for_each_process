Windbg extension to execute a command for every process.

Windbg already has

  !for_each_frame
  !for_each_function
  !for_each_local
  !for_each_module
  !for_each_register

For some reason !for_each_process and !for_each_thread are only available in
kernel mode. This adds the trivial implementation of

  !for_each_process

which does what you would expect.
