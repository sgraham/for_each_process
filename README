Windbg extension to execute a command for every process.

Windbg already has

  !for_each_frame
  !for_each_function
  !for_each_local
  !for_each_module
  !for_each_register

For some reason !for_each_process and !for_each_thread are only available in
kernel mode. This adds the trivial implementation of

  !for_each_process

To use it,

  .load c:\path\to\for_each_process.dll

then e.g.:

  !for_each_process "bm something!MyFunction"
